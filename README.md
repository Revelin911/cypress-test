## Description

This project allows users to search and save books in an organized manner. The reason behind this is for users to have a seamless experience while performing certain actions. Being able to go through the database will help users view books and then view the ones they saved separately. This project uses Google Books API with a MongoDB database. I was able to learn how to rewirk some of starter code to go from RESTful API to using MongoDB database. It helped me get more practice in mapping out each step and adding the proper functions accordingly.
